### **Getting Started**

Xyla can be included in any web page by inserting a `<script>` tag in the `<head>`.

To get started, paste this snippet into the HTML editor:

```html
<script src="node_modules/xylo/dist/umd/xylo.min.js"></script>
```

You can now use the `xyla` library from within your page!
